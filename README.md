<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Users can play against the computer by selecting one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. After making their selection, the computer randomly chooses one of the options, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
The project includes features such as score tracking, visual feedback, and responsive design to provide an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience. The user's score, including the number of wins, losses, and ties, is displayed on the web page and stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across page reloads and browser sessions. Visual feedback is provided after each round, indicating the user's move, the computer's move, and the result of the game.
